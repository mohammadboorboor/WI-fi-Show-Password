# Windows Wi-Fi Password Retriever

This is a Python script that retrieves and displays saved Wi-Fi passwords on Windows using the netsh command-line utility. The script presents the results in a user-friendly table format that shows the SSID and corresponding password.

# Installation

To use this script, you'll need Python 3 and the termcolor , subprocess and pyfiglet libraries installed on your system. To install these libraries, you can use pip by running the following command:

* pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

To run the script, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script file. Then, run the following command:
